# P vs. NP: The $1 Million Question

The P vs. NP problem is a major unsolved problem in theoretical computer science. It deals with the speed at which a computer can solve a problem.

### 🧩 Defining the Classes

1. **P (Polynomial Time):** Problems that are "easy" for a computer to solve. 
   * *Example:* Sorting a list of numbers or searching for a name in a phone book.
2. **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time):** Problems where a solution can be "easily" verified, but finding the solution might take billions of years.
   * *Example:* Solving a Sudoku puzzle. Checking a finished grid is fast, but solving an empty one is much harder.

### ❓ The Big Question: Does P = NP?
If you find a way to verify a solution quickly, does that mean there *must* be a fast way to solve it? 
* Most scientists believe **P ≠ NP**, meaning there are some problems that are fundamentally hard.
* If **P = NP**, it would change the world. Modern cryptography (like the locks on your bank account) would break instantly because "checking" a key and "finding" a key would become equally easy.
