# The SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### 🧱 The 5 Principles

1. **S - Single Responsibility:** A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. (Don't make "God Objects" that do everything).
2. **O - Open/Closed:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. (Add new features by adding code, not by rewriting old code).
3. **L - Liskov Substitution:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
4. **I - Interface Segregation:** No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. (Split large interfaces into smaller, specific ones).
5. **D - Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions. (High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level details).



### 💡 Why Use SOLID?
Using these principles prevents **"Code Rot."** It ensures that when you change one part of your app, the rest of it doesn't spontaneously catch fire.
